    <h3>
      <p>
        OOooh my Godness!!! We found ourselves in a terrible situation in our very country
        in which in-security corruption, immorality Robbery and Kidnapping became order of the day.
        Always Government tries in budgetting huge amount Money so as to rectify and wipe the in-security off,
        yet the Short coming remains constant as if it is adding Gas to a Fire;
        because the Problem has to be eradicated from the root first then Branches, as we Know Charity began at Home,
        it has to be Overcome from Federal Level,State level and Local level.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now how we tackle the In-security issues in the Society level, and
        don’t forget the main Key point to this problem is poverty;
        Ok the Question is that do we not have Wealth be Capital or Money to remedy the issues of Poverty ?
        the Answer is that we have ; But now do we do that Yes ofcourse,
        But the Supportive or Aid are not reach the people that Supposed to own.
        As long as our Society continues going in such system there must be a greater problem or
        that would be more than current one in Comparison,
        Unless Government has a Census process enabling her noticing the actual number of people surving
        or living in the Each Society, in such away that it can help them with necessary things they may required.
        Okay let’s say Government has a lot to deal with it has no any subsidy to subsidize it’s citizens cause of the
        Capital bourgeoisies that want to help at need,
        Despite their aim, I don’t think they can achieve because we lack Census approach insuring that ,
        So as when so ever an aid is given will reach the beneficiary Rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this I can Say Perharp our Traditional Rulers, those that are shouldering our responsibility are not Playing
        their Role well,
        yet Government can add value to these Rulers by providing them specific Purpose Computer that has Capability
        and ability of estimating and enumerating the total number of Recidents in any Given Area that a Particular
        Traditional leader leading it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile; the system that should provided must comprises the Following Functionality or Qualities :
        <br>
        <br>- Total Number of Resident Houses in the Area.
        <br>- Total Number of People Living in the respective houses
        <br>- It should indicate whether the Owner of the houses is alive or dead
        <br>- It should posses the Quality to Separate Orphans from who are not.
        <br>- It should identify those with Special needs
        <br>- It should be able to signify the total fields that are un-built
        <br>- It should be able to signify the total Mosques in the Area
        <br>- It should indicates total Islamic and Western Education Schools and identify their Lecures and Teachers
        And when there is Stranger the System should be loaded with the information concerning him or her ,just to be
        awared.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        However, if there is loosing of Life there should be editing in the died File.
        And at Last Updated File and Analysis would be generated Monthly Report
        And other Functionality can be added while Analysis the Project.</p>
      <p>
        Yes, indeed if there will be this system or Modern Approach of Identifying People in Society
        there might not be Squat that Kidnappers, Robberies, and Other insurgerits do to dis-stabise the Country.
        And again believe me, for this if the Aids or Helps come will reach the beneficiary Directly.
        With this extra-ordinary Software by Allah will, all the menaces that we encounter in term of In-Security would
        be destroyed and Deconstructed.
